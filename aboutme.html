              Hi, my name is Sergei Diakov, I am a geologist and an artist.
            </ul>
            <ul>
              I had a long professional career of conducting exploration for
              mineral deposits of copper and gold around the world working for
              several leading mining companies.
            </ul>
            <ul>
              With PhD in economic geology, I led exploration teams to several
              successful world-class discoveries in Asia and South America. In
              pursuing my professional goals, I accumulated significant
              experience in different cultural environments around the globe.
            </ul>
            <ul>
              While traveling to remote corners of the world, I enjoyed various
              landscapes and unforgettable natural scenes. My eyes capture a
              combination of amazingly impressive natural beauty and geological
              structure created by Mother Earth.
            </ul>
            <ul>
              I started developing artistic skills from early childhood in the
              Ukraine. During my education at the university in Moscow, I had a
              great opportunity to spend time with a famous Russian artist
              <a
                class="link"
                target="_blank"
                href="https://www.artnet.com/artists/oleg-grosse/"
                >Oleg Grosse</a
              >
              in his studio. Profound philosophical thinking of beauty and love
              conquering the world has occupied my thinking since that time. One
              can find them in my paintings.
            </ul>
            <ul>
              I live in Escondido, California, with my lovely family; my dear
              wife Alevtina and my son Dmitri. The local nature is becoming a
              dominating theme in my modern paintings. My art has a thought
              provoking charge and will make a living treasure for every member
              of the entire family household to enjoy and inspire.
